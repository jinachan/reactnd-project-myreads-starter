# MyReads Project

Author: Jina Chan

Created for: Udacity Front-End Nanodegree (FEND) 2018

## Description
This React web application lets you organize your books among three shelves: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read. You can add books by searching the database for a title or author, then select which shelf to move it to.

Beginning with a single-component static design, I created a dynamically rendering app by adding the following functionality:

* Multiple components in a logical hierarchy
* State using API calls to request data from the server and pass updates to it
* Use of lifecycle event ComponentDidMount()
* Props to pass values to child components
* React Router to control navigation between pages

## Installation
1. Download all files
2. Install all project dependencies with `npm install`
3. start the development server with `npm start`

## Project Requirements
The project must meet this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/918/view).
